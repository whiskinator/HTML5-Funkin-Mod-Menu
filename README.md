funny friday night funkin song packs on psych engine 0.5.1 (these arent actual full mods)
song packs are kept relatively small so that i can load them on my god awful school chromebook, sorry if it's annoying to switch between so many websites!!

oh my hard drive also exploded so i lost all my files and have basically nothing for now!! will need time to port stuff again
